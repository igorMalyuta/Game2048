# Game2048

This is my educational implementation of game 2048 with GUI.

List of hot keys:

      'A' - automatic move (effective)
      
      'R' - random move
      
      'Z' - undo move
      
      'ESC' - reset game board
      
      'Up','Down','Right','Left' - movement in the appropriate direction
